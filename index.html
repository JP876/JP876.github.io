                        Robotics is a very broad science so some knowledge is needed to make the topic  easier to understand, and apply it more efficiently in practice.

                        The best way to really learn something is through some form of practice. To achieve this, is to use previously acquired knowledge to make some projects.

                    We are a small team that is passionate about robotics and its progress. We believe that robots can help people in their daily tasks and improve living conditions. We also believe that robots cannot replace human interaction and that this is not their main purpose. As robots start to appear more and more often, we created this page to make as many people as possible familiar with the world of robotics.
